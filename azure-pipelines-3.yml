# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

jobs:
- job: Foo
  steps:
  - script: echo Hello!
    condition: always() # this step runs, even if the build is canceled
  - script: |
      echo "This task will fail."
      exit 1 
- job: Bar
  dependsOn: Foo
  condition: failed() # this job runs only if Foo fails
